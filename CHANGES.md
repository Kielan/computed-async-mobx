## 1.1.0

* Enhanced error handling: `rethrow` option causes errors to be rethrown when `value` is accessed in `fail` state.
* `fetch` function can optionally return a plain value.

## 1.0.0

* Added error handling (issue #2).
* Most recent current value persists when not being observed. This should be less surprising behaviour and is more consistent with behaviour of the new error-related properties.

## 0.2.0

* Initial public publish.
